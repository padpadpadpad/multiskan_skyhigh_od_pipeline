# MultiSkan SkyHigh OD pipeline

This is a pipeline that makes it easy to process data from the ThermoFisher Multiskan Skyhigh plate readers. It relies heavily on the [**tidyverse**](https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/) and [**gcplyr**](https://mikeblazanin.github.io/gcplyr/). I recommend reading the walkthroughs within **gcplyr** for an in-depth description of how it works and things you need to think about! It also uses [**nls.multstart**](https://github.com/padpadpadpad/nls.multstart) and model formulations from [**growthrates**](https://github.com/tpetzoldt/growthrates) to fit several mechanistic models. Lots of this code is likely applicable to other plate readers, but some of the functions in **00_functions.R** would need to be edited.

## Help improve this repository

I would love for this repository to be improved by you! Coding is much more fun - and robust - when we work together. If you have suggestions for how the code (or pipeline more generally) can be improved please open an [Issue](https://github.com/padpadpadpad/multiskan_skyhigh_od_pipeline/issues). Or add scripts and submit a Pull Request.

## TLDR How to use this repository

- Download this repository and place it in the folder where you are collecting data on a new project.
- Rename `multiskan_skyhigh_od_pipeline.Rproj` to better reflect the active project.
- Put raw data files into `data/raw`. **DO NOT PUT RAW FILES ANYWHERE ELSE.**
- Go through the scripts in numbered order to process your data.
- Make edits to the scripts as necessary to suit your needs.
- At the end of **04_analyse_gcplyr.R** and **05_analyse_growthrates.R** you should have a processed dataset of growth metrics and growth models to use in downstream analyses.


## Naming raw and processed files

How you name files is key for analysing data spread across multiple files. Naming in a consistent way allows you to combine data from multiple files, and allows you to describe metadata. The processed files from this pipeline are labelled with the numbers of the script that made them, allowing you to keep track of output more easily. For example, **01_data.csv** will have been made from **01_read_od.R**.

For raw files, here are my recommendations, but generally you just need to be consistent:

- Use lowercase letters, with underscores separating treatments.
- Start each name with "run**A**" where **A** is the run number. This allows all the raw and processed data through the scripts to be easily referenced.
- After the **run** naming, I would have a reference for the treatment for each plate - if it has one - separated with an underscore.
- For example, if I was analysing plates that were done at different temperatures, I would name the files "run**A**_temp**B**" where **A** is the run number (chronologically from the first you do during an experiment) and **B** is the temperature. For the first run at 40ÂºC, This would return a file name **run1_temp40.xlsx**.

## Plate layout

To be able to assign meta-data to each plate, you need to go into each raw file and fill in the design template in the **Plate layout** tab. Once this is done, save the file and close it. A layout may look like this.

## Correcting blanks

Currently, we assume blank wells start with an **"C"**, but this can be changed in **03_process_od.R**.

## The pipeline

The pipeline is made of a number of scripts that are designed to be ran chronologically from **01** to **05**. These take you from reading in raw data to fitting growth models, with scripts to create plots throughout the process.

The scripts are:

- **00_functions.R**: contains helper functions that are used in other scripts to read in data exported from the MultiSkan SkyHigh.
- **01_read_od.R**: reads in raw data files from the MultiSkan SkyHigh plate reader. 
- **02_visualise_runs.R**: Visualises the raw data from a run of a MultiSkan Skyhigh plate readers. Creates a pdf of the raw data in `plots/first_look_plots`. At this stage it might be useful to look at each plot and note down specific well by file combinations that have failed/have poor data to remove from downstream analyses. It is also good to check whether any of your blanks have been contaminated.
- **03_process_od.R**: processes raw data files. It does blank correction, removes blanks, and removes erroneous wells before saving out a processed dataset.
- **04_analyse_gcplyr.R**: Calculates growth metrics from the processed datasets and creates visualisations of the processed datasets, indicating the position of lag time, maximum growth rate, and maximum density in each well of a plate.
    - Currently uses **gcplyr** to calculate max growth rate, minimum density, lag time, time at which max growth rate was estimated, density at which max growth rate was calculated, maximum density, time at which max density was reached, doubling time, and area under the curve.
    - Makes visualisation of the growth metrics on the raw and log scale for corrected OD. This needs a lot of changing based on the treatments and grouping variables you have.
- **05_analyse_growthmodels.R**: Fits growth models to the processed datasets and creates a visualisation of the processed dataset with fitted curves to the data.
    - Takes the model formulations from [**growthrates**](https://github.com/tpetzoldt/growthrates) and fits them using [**nls.multstart**](https://github.com/padpadpadpad/nls.multstart). Currently it fits the logisitc, gompertz, baranyi, richards, and huang models. 
    - When fitting, it sets parameter limits based on the data and biologically implausible values. For all models, it sets the upper limit on **n0** - the initial density - to be between the lowest non-zero value. This is changeable.
    - Makes visualistion of all models on a plate by plate basis. This code needs changing based on the grouping variables you have.

## Where you have to make changes

This is where things get fun. Although this pipeline is designed to be easy to use and reproducible, your specific use-case likely differs to mine. As such, it is important you go through the code the first time you use it to understand what everything is doing. This will also help you understand how to make changes to the code to suit your needs.

Each script has a section called "things to change". We will go through each in turn.

### 01_read_od.R

- Need to make sure you are reading in the right files and that you set `output` to be the correct name for the output file. 

### 02_visualise_runs.R

- **02_visualise_runs.R**: Need to make sure you are reading in the right files. A good rule of thumb is to set `input` to be the same as `output` from **01_read_od.R**.

### 03_process_od.R

- Need to make sure you are reading in the right files. You may want to split up the column named `file` into the different treatments. This can be done using **tidyr::separate()**. If you do this, you may want to change the variables in `groupings` to reflect this.
- You can set the method for calculating blanks to either `blank_median` or `well_specific`. It is `blank_median` by default, which takes all the blanks per plate and calculates the median and sd of `raw_absorbance`. If there are any contaminated blanks you should check WHY and remove them. The `well_specific` method calculates the mean `raw_absorbance` from the first three time points of each well, representing a well-specific blank. This is based on guidance from [Atolia (2020) mBio](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.01378-20). Using the first few timepoints to subtract was used by [Govers (2024) Cell Systems](https://www.cell.com/cell-systems/fulltext/S2405-4712(23)00331-9). This method relies on cultures not yet reaching their detectable range.
- Set how often the plate reader was taking measurements (assumed to be ubiquitous across all runs). Sets window width as number of measurements in 1 hour.
- At ~Line 120 under the comment `# quick plot of data ####`, you may need to change the grouping variables to get a nice overall plot. Specifically might want to change `facet_wrap()` and `interaction(well, run)` to reflect your grouping variables.
- At ~Line 137 there is a section that allows you to remove wells that have biologically implausible signal. This could mean a massive spike in the OD reading that will likely result in poor modelling. If you have enough replicates, you should be able to afford to lose a couple of wells that are perhaps behaving badly. You need to input the IDs of the wells that are to be removed.

### 04_analyse_gcplyr.R

- Need to make sure you are reading in the right files. You may want to split up the column named `file` into the different treatments. This can be done using **tidyr::separate()**. If you do this, you may want to change the variables in `groupings` to reflect this.

- From ~Line 420, a for loop creates a pdfs of each plate with the estimated growth curves placed on top of the raw data. This code currently needs a lot of editing to make sure your grouping variables are correct. It currently assumes you have different runs and temperatures within runs.
